            <h1>Calvin</h1>
            <h5>Age 6</h5>
            <p>Calvin, named after the 16th-century theologian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Calvin" target="_blank">John Calvin</a>, is a six-year-old, whose last name is never mentioned in the strip. Despite his poor grades in school, Calvin demonstrates his intelligence through his sophisticated vocabulary and a philosophical mind:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Calvin: "Dad, are you vicariously living through me in the hope that my accomplishments will validate your mediocre life and in some way compensate for all of the opportunities you botched?"</p>
                <p>Dad: "If I were, you can bet I'd be re-evaluating my strategy."</p>
                <p>Calvin (later, to his mother): "Mom, Dad keeps insulting me."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>He commonly wears his distinctive red-and-black striped shirt, black pants, and white-and-magenta sneakers. He also wears a jacket when going to school or when playing in the snow. He is an enthusiastic reader of comic books and has a tendency to order items marketed in comic books or on boxes of his favorite cereal, Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs.</p> 
            <p>Watterson described Calvin:</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                <p>Calvin is pretty easy to do because he is outgoing and rambunctious, and there's not much of a filter between his brain and his mouth.</p>
                <p>I guess he's a little too intelligent for his age. The thing that I really enjoy about him is that he has no sense of restraint; he doesn't have the experience yet to know the things that you shouldn't do.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Calvin also has a sensitive side as well. This is displayed, for example, when he finds a dying raccoon and tries to save it but fails. The scene is made even more poignant by Calvin asking Hobbes not to "go anywhere" while Hobbes hugs him and promises him he won't.</p>
