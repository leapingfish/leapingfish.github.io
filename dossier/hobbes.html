            <h1>Hobbes</h1>
            <h5>Species Bengal Tiger</h5>
            <p>From Calvin's point of view, Hobbes is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism" target="_blank">anthropomorphic</a> tiger, much larger than Calvin and full of independent attitudes and ideas. When the perspective shifts to any other character, readers again see merely a stuffed animal, usually seated at an off-kilter angle and blankly staring into space.</p>
            <p>Watterson explains:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>When Hobbes is a stuffed toy in one panel and alive in the next, I'm juxtaposing the 'grown-up' version of reality with Calvin's version, and inviting the reader to decide which is truer.</p>
                <p>In more than one strip, Hobbes is shown being washed in a washing machine, a fact Hobbes takes in stride and which Watterson has referred to as "one of the stranger blurrings of what Hobbes is."</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>Hobbes is named after the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, who held what Watterson describes as "a dim view of human nature."[37] Hobbes (the tiger) is much more rational and aware of consequences than Calvin, but seldom interferes with Calvin's troublemaking beyond a few oblique warnings. Hobbes is sarcastic when Calvin is being hypocritical about things he dislikes.</p>
            <p>Although the debut strip shows Calvin capturing Hobbes by means of a snare (with a tuna sandwich as the bait), a later comic (August 1, 1989) indicates that Hobbes has been with Calvin since Calvin was a baby:</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p>Calvin: "The whole first half of my life is a complete blank! What on earth did I know that someone wanted me to forget?"</p>
                <p>Hobbes: "I seem to recall you spent most of the time burping up."</p>
                
            </blockquote>
            <p>Another later strip featured Hobbes claiming that Calvin's mom "wanted another tiger " instead of Calvin, indicating that Hobbes was around before Calvin was born. Watterson eventually decided that it was not important to establish how Calvin and Hobbes met.</p>
